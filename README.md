# Greetings-React-Front-End

The React-Redux front_end of an app that displays a random greeting when the user clicks on a button labeled: "Get another greeting". The database is seeded with 5 different greetings which display on the browser, one at a time. Upon loading the greetings page the user will find one out of those 5 greetings randomly displayed:

![Greetings](/public/Greeting1.png?raw=true "random greeting")

The user can then click the button to see another greeting randomly display.

![Greetings](/public/Greeting2.png?raw=true "random greeting")
